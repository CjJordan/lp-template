# Java/Angular Web Development Mini-Bootcamp

### Course Overview: 

The Java/Angular Web Development Mini-Bootcamp is a fast-paced exciting mini-course in which students will build 
and deploy a full-stack progressive web application. Students will leave with a strong foundation in version control (Git/GitHub), 
Spring Boot, JPA, Angular 8, and Material UI. 

### Course Goal: 

The goal of the course is to improve the employability of students by teaching practical software development skills 
while providing a cohesive understanding of full-stack web development. 

### Student Expectations

Students will be expected to attend every session. In this condensed format, missing a single class is like missing a week 
in a normal classroom, as such missing class is strongly discouraged. 

Additionally students will be expected to complete all homework. Homework is provided for students' personal edification and 
will not be turned in or graded. Though homework will not be monitored, practice is a cornerstone of learning and will be key 
to success in the course. 

### Prerequisites: 

CS 1301: Programming Principles I (Java) or equivalent

CS 1302: Programming Principles II (Java) or equivalent

Students should be familiar with fundamental programming contructs (such as loops, conditionals, and methods), possess a 
working knowledge of foundational OOP principles (including classes, object instantiation, and inheritance), and be comfortable 
working with basic data structures (Lists and Maps). 

### Set up: 

__IDE__: Students will need an IDE. I'll personally be using IntelliJ. Students are welcome to use any IDE that they prefer provided 
they are comfortable independently navigating and working in their chosen IDE. Students who have no prefered IDE or are
uncomfortable with their IDE should use IntelliJ Community Edition. 

__JDK__: I'll be using Java JDK 11, students are welcome to use whatever version of Java they prefer, however I may use 
Java 8+ specific syntax in class. 

All other installs (Including Node, Angular CLI, and database dependencies) and will be managed during class. 

### Format: 

__Duration__: 5 weeks

__Schedule__: 4pm - 7pm EST Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
