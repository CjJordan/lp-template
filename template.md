# Title - 1.1

( This template allows 10 min of unscheduled time. This is vital as it allows instructors to provide more time for activities, reviews, or lectures to suit their particular student base )

## Level-Set ( 15 min )

### Recap

Quickly recap the 3-4 high level takeaways from the previous class. 

### Learner Objectives
After this lesson, students will be able: 
1. (this should be demonstrable and measurable)
2. (try to steer clear of passive learning objectives)
3. (for example: "create mood boards that convey a design direction" rather than "explain the role of mood boards")

Remind students that if they cannot meet any of these objectives it is their responsibility to seek help. 

### Demo

Demo what students will be able to do with the knowledge they learn today. For example, if the topics of the day are HTML, CSS, and media-queries, demo a mobile responsive web app and point out the role HTML, CSS, and media-queries play.

## Topic 1 ( 45 min )

### Instructor Do: Sub-Topic A  ( 15 min )
![lecture][lecture] _lecture_

Explain a concept here. Use **analogies**. Point out the practical applications of this concept by using **anecdotes** from your work life or by pointing to its use in applications that students are familiar with. 

Talking points and action items do NOT need to be bulleted. **Bullets create unecessary clutter**. Keep each paragraph short and digestible. 

Use `**` to bold relevant words that will make the lesson plan easier to parse at glance in class. 

> "Use blockquotes to indicate an important quote for instructors to say. Use this sparingly. This can be especially useful for important definitions or difficult concepts to explain."

Keep the "Instructor Do" instructive but concise. 

![discuss][discuss] _discussion_

Leading discussions is a great way to increase engagement and check for student understanding. Try these tactics: 

- ask open-ended probing questions
- ask learners to explain a concept back to you
- ask learners why this concept is important/where it might be applicable 
- call on learners to get the discussion started

### Partner Do: Sub-Topic A ( 20 min )
![create][create] _learner create_

Insturctor notes should go here above instructions. 

Distribute the following: 

_[links to starter files go here]_

**Instructions**

This is student facing material. Include and number steps when applicable. 

### Instructor Review: Sub-Topic A ( 10 min )
![critique][critique] _critique_

Give students 60 seconds to upload their work to slack. 

Pull up a student file on the projector.

Call on a different student. Ask them what their favorite part of this solution is and what they might do differently.

## Break ( 10 min )

## Topic 2 ( 45 min )

### Instructor Do: Sub-Topic A ( 10 min )
![lecture][lecture] _lecture_

Time for more lecture. The lesson is divided into three 45 minute sections. This helps to **focus** each lesson around 3 topics that all support 1 over-arching concept. "Instructor Do"s should be **limited to 15 minutes** max. Consider these layouts for the 45 minute sections: 

#### I Do, We Do, You Do
- Instructor Do ( 10 min )
- We Do ( 10 min )
- Student Do ( 15 min )
- Instructor Review ( 10 min )

This layout is great for more difficult concepts. Begin by explaining a concept, then model the behavior as learners follow along in the "We Do", and finally allow learners to independently apply the new skill in the "Student Do". 

#### The Double Whammy
- Instructor Do ( 10 min )
- Student Do ( 10 min )
- Instructor Review ( 5 min )
- Instructor Do ( 5 min )
- Student Do ( 10 min )
- Instructor Review ( 5 min )

This is best for concept or task that has two parts. For example when teaching CSS animations, first teach keyframes and allow learners to apply the new concept. Then demo multistep animations and give learners an opprtunity to apply this new layer. 

This can also be useful for complex concepts. The first activity is a monkey-see-monkey-do activity. The second activity provides learners a more challenging application. 

#### The Mini Project
- Instructor Do ( 10 min )
- Student Do ( 25 min )
- Instructor Review ( 10 min )

This is a way to provide learners time to pull together disperate concepts into a single project or to spend time architecting a solution before jumping in. This is a great end of day option. 

### Partner Do: Sub-Topic A ( 10 min )
![create][create] _learner create_

Insturctor notes should go here above instructions. 

Distribute the following: 

_[links to starter files go here]_

**Instructions**

This is student facing material. Include and number steps when applicable. 

### Instructor Review: Sub-Topic A ( 5 min )

Review the solution. 

### Instructor Do: Sub-Topic B ( 5 min )
![demo-code][demo-code] _demo code_

When possible sample code should be written in-line. This allows instructors to teach without flipping between files.

Break down coding demos into easily digestible steps with explanations for each. 

In-line code should be written between three backticks and include the syntax highlighting keyword like `js`, `html`, `css`, etc. 

```js
const x = 4
```

![note][note] _note_

You can easily gauge the layout of your lesson plan by reviewing your icon colors. **Blues** are student activities and are more engaging. **Greens** are instructor lead but student driven with fairly high student engagement. **Yellows** are instructor lead and are low engagement.

Try to write a rainbow lesson plan! 

### Partner Do: Sub-Topic B ( 10 min )
![learn-code][learn-code] _learner code_

Insturctor notes should go here above instructions. 

Distribute the following: 

_[links to starter files go here]_

**Instructions**

This is student facing material. Include and number steps when applicable. 

### Instructor Review: Sub-Topic B ( 5 min )

Review the solution. 

---
## Break ( 10 min )
![break][break]

---
## Topic 3 ( 45 min )

### Instructor Do: Sub-Topic A ( 10 min )
![lecture][lecture] _lecture_

More lecture, but that doesn't have to mean boring. Try writing in engagement tactics like fist-to-fives, asking students questions, and including short (60 second) thought exercises, research opportunities, or turn and talks (t&t for in-person only). 

### Partner Do: Sub-Topic A ( 25 min )
![create][create] _learner create_

Insturctor notes should go here above instructions. 

Distribute the following: 

_[links to starter files go here]_

**Instructions**

This is student facing material. Include and number steps when applicable. 

### Instructor Review: Sub-Topic A ( 10 min )

Review the solution or guide students through a good approach if there is no singular solution. Call on students to help you solve the problem or to repeat certain explanations back to you.
